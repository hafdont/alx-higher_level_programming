Python Hello World Project
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and programs that cover various fundamental concepts and tasks. The scripts range from basic print statements to more advanced topics like working with linked lists and bytecode.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each containing Python scripts related to specific tasks:

0-run: Shell script for running a Python script specified in the environment variable $PYFILE.

Example: ./0-run
1-run_inline: Shell script for running Python code specified in the environment variable $PYCODE.

Example: ./1-run_inline
2-print.py: Python script that prints a specific string using the print function.

Example: ./2-print.py
3-print_number.py: Python script to print an integer stored in a variable, followed by a string.

Example: ./3-print_number.py
4-print_float.py: Python script to print a float with a precision of 2 digits.

Example: ./4-print_float.py
5-print_string.py: Python script to print a string three times followed by its first 9 characters.

Example: ./5-print_string.py
6-concat.py: Python script to concatenate strings and print a specific message.

Example: ./6-concat.py
7-edges.py: Python script to extract and print specific portions of a string.

Example: ./7-edges.py
8-concat_edges.py: Python script to print a new sentence by concatenating specific portions of a string.

Example: ./8-concat_edges.py
9-easter_egg.py: Python script to print "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

Example: ./9-easter_egg.py
10-check_cycle.c: C program to check if a singly linked list has a cycle.

Example: ./cycle
100-write.py: Python script to print a specific message to stderr and exit with status code 1.

Example: ./100-write.py
101-compile: Shell script to compile a Python script file specified in the environment variable $PYFILE.

Example: ./101-compile
102-magic_calculation.py: Python function magic_calculation(a, b) designed to match specific Python bytecode.

Usage Instructions
For each script or program, refer to the provided examples for usage instructions. Additionally, some scripts may require specific environment variables, as indicated in the corresponding section.
