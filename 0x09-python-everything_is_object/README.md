*** Python Everything is an Object ***


This project delves into the intricacies of object-oriented programming in Python, focusing on fundamental concepts such as object types, mutability, aliasing, and variable behavior.

Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be proficient in:

Understanding Python's unique approach to objects
Distinguishing between mutable and immutable objects
Exploring aliasing and its consequences
Differentiating between object equality and identity
Investigating the mutability of built-in data types
Grasping the concept of reference in Python
Tasks
The project consists of a series of tasks designed to reinforce your understanding of Python's object-oriented nature. You'll answer questions and predict the output of specific code snippets to solidify your comprehension.

How to Use
Answer Files: Each task has an associated answer file with a concise response.

Python Scripts: Some tasks involve writing Python scripts. Follow the provided instructions to complete these scripts.

README.md: This detailed README serves as a guide, providing an overview of the project, objectives, and instructions for completing tasks.

Code Style
Follow the PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code. Use the pycodestyle tool (version 2.8.*) to check for compliance.
