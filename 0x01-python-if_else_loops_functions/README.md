## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each located in the `0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions` directory. Here's an overview of the tasks:

1. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
   - A program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

2. **The last digit**
   - A program that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of that number.

3. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
   - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

4. **Hexadecimal printing**
   - A program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal format.

5. **00...99**
   - A program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in two-digit format, separated by commas.

6. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
   - A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7. **islower**
   - A function that checks if a character is lowercase.

8. **To uppercase**
   - A function that prints a string in uppercase.

9. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
    - A function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. **a + b**
    - A function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. **a ^ b**
    - A function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

12. **Fizz Buzz**
    - A function that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions.

13. **Insert in sorted linked list**
    - A function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

14. **Smile in the mirror**
    - A program that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase.

15. **Remove at position**
    - A function that creates a copy of a string, removing the character at a given position.

16. **ByteCode -> Python #2**
    - A Python function equivalent to a given Python bytecode.

## Usage

Each Python script can be executed as follows:

```bash
./script_name.py
For C scripts, you can compile and run as follows:

bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 script_name.c -o executable_name
./executable_name
Make sure to replace script_name and executable_name accordingly.
