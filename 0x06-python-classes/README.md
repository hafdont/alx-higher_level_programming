0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and classes that delve into the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and classes in Python. The tasks encompass various aspects, including class creation, attribute handling, size validation, method implementation, and even bytecode translation.

File Descriptions
0-square.py

Description: An introductory script with an empty class Square that defines the basics of a square.
Usage: $ cat 0-main.py | ./0-main.py
1-square.py

Description: A script introducing a class Square with a private attribute size.
Usage: $ cat 1-main.py | ./1-main.py
2-square.py

Description: Implementation of a Square class with size validation.
Usage: $ cat 2-main.py | ./2-main.py
3-square.py

Description: Enhancement of the Square class with an area method for calculating the area of the square.
Usage: $ cat 3-main.py | ./3-main.py
4-square.py

Description: Further refinement of the Square class with getter and setter methods for a private attribute, along with size validation.
Usage: $ cat 4-main.py | ./4-main.py
5-square.py

Description: Expansion of the Square class with a my_print method for printing the square and handling optional position attributes.
Usage: $ cat 5-main.py | ./5-main.py
6-square.py

Description: Introduction of the position attribute to the Square class, modification of the my_print method to accommodate the position, and other improvements.
Usage: $ cat 6-main.py | ./6-main.py
100-singly_linked_list.py

Description: Implementation of a singly linked list with classes Node and SinglyLinkedList. The list supports insertion in sorted order.
Usage: $ cat 100-main.py | ./100-main.py
101-square.py

Description: Enhancement of the Square class to include a __str__ method for better string representation.
Usage: $ cat 101-main.py | ./101-main.py
102-square.py

Description: Extension of the Square class with support for comparison operators based on square area.
Usage: $ cat 102-main.py | ./102-main.py
103-magic_class.py

Description: Implementation of the Python class MagicClass to replicate the behavior specified in given Python bytecode.
Usage: $ cat 103-main.py | ./103-main.py
How to Use
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. To test each script, create a simple main script (e.g., main.py) and import the corresponding class. Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
$ ./main.py
Replace the script name and imported class as needed for different tasks.
